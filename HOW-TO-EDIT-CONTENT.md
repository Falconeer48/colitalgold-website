## Note About Static HTML

**Important:** Your website currently uses static HTML files. The content files I created contain all your current content, but the website HTML still has the content hardcoded.

**Two options:**
1. **Edit content files in Decap CMS** - changes will be saved to GitHub (good for version control)
2. **Later, we can update the website** to dynamically load from these content files (requires JavaScript)

For now, you can edit everything in Decap CMS and I can help you integrate it into the website later if needed!
