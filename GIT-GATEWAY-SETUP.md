# Using Git Gateway (Simpler Method)

## ✅ What I've Done

I've switched back to using **git-gateway** which:
- ✅ Works with your already-enabled Git Gateway
- ✅ Uses Netlify Identity (deprecated but still functional)
- ✅ Much simpler - no OAuth proxy needed
- ✅ Should work immediately

## Current Setup

- ✅ Git Gateway: Enabled
- ✅ Netlify Identity: Enabled (deprecated but functional)
- ✅ Config updated to use `git-gateway` backend
