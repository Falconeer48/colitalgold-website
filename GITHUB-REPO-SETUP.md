# Create GitHub Repository - Step by Step

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Git repository initialized (DONE)
- ⏳ GitHub account (create one if needed)

### Instructions

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open: https://github.com/
   - Sign in (or create free account)

2. **Create New Repository:**
   - Click the **"+"** icon in top right corner
   - Select **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in Repository Details:**
   - **Repository name:** `colitasgold-website`
   - **Description:** (optional) "ColitasGold Website"
   - **Visibility:** 
     - Choose **Public** (free, anyone can see code)
     - Or **Private** (only you can see)
   - **Important:** 
     - ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
     - ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore"
     - ❌ DO NOT select a license
   - Leave everything unchecked!

4. **Click "Create repository"**

### After Creating

GitHub will show you a page with commands. **Don't run them yet!** 

You'll see something like:
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/colitasgold-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Save your repository URL** - you'll need it in the next step!
